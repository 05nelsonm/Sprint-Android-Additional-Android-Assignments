## Overview
Build an app which updates the position of a seekbar for a mediaplayer 

## Requirements
This app will consist of a Media acitvity with your own UI that will play a locally stored media file (audio/video).    
1)The position of the seekbar should be updated every second as the media is playing.   
2)The user should be able to play/pause the media and seek to any position at any time. 


## Outline
1. Create a project and add any media source in the raw directory(audio/video)
2. Add your own UI to the app for the seekbar, play/pause buttons
3. Add clicklisteners for the play/pause buttons to properly prepare and play the media.
4. Use the Handler class in Android to run a piece of code repeatedly every second. 
This code should update the position of the seekbar for the media.

## Go Further
- Repeat this project using ExoPlayer instead of the traditional MediaPlayer.
- Add two buttons for fastforward_increment and rewind_increment in the UI and implement it
